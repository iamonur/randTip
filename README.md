- #randTip
randTip is a bash script that prints a random tip from a file called tips. Suggested way of using it is to append the script to the ~/.bashrc file. In that way, a random tip for every terminal session will be displayed. Currently, randTip includes this categories:
- Linux system programming
- Linux for newbies(Like me)
- bash usage
- More categories and new tips will be included by time.

To install randTip to bashrc, clone the repo and run "bash install.sh"
Also, you can uninstall it using "bash uninstall.sh"

This readme file will be updated.
